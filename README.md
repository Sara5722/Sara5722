# Hi there, I'm Sara ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Data Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago, concentrating in Computer Science. Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering patterns in data and turning them into insights that solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’» Through a mix of coursework and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in programming, statistics, and data analysis. 

ðŸš€ I'm currently part of the [Break Through Tech AI](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/ai/) program, where Iâ€™m expanding my skills through project-based learning, mentorship, and collaboration.
